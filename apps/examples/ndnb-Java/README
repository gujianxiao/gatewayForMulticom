This directory contains an example of extending 'ndnb' encoding/decoding to other Java
data types.  It includes JUnit tests for the encoder/decoder.  It also includes tests
for the XML schema.

There are 2 components that are required to extend the use of 'ndnb'.  The first is
specifying the XML 'schema' that defines the extensions.  The second is the Java code 
the implements the schema.

The './schema' directory contains the following files:

	example.xsd
		This file defines the schema used in these examples.

	tagname.csvdict
		This file define the XML tags for use with the NDNx 'ndnb' tools.  (See the man pages for ndn_ndnbtoxml and ndn_xmltondnb.)
	
	validate.sh
		This script sets up and runs the tests defined for this schema.

	2-integers-test01.xml
	complicated-test01.xml
	complicated-test02.xml
		These XML source files are used by validate.sh to ensure that the schema defined by example.xsd correctly parses the test XML files.


The following files implement the schema described by example.xsd:

	src/org/ndnx/ndn/apps/examples/ndnb/ExampleDictionary.java
	src/org/ndnx/ndn/apps/examples/ndnb/ExampleDTags.java
	src/org/ndnx/ndn/apps/examples/ndnb/Example2Integers.java
	src/org/ndnx/ndn/apps/examples/ndnb/ExampleComplicated.java
	src/org/ndnx/ndn/apps/examples/ndnb/Enumeration.java
	src/org/ndnx/ndn/apps/examples/ndnb/StringBinaryVector.java

The JUnit test implemented for this example are in:
