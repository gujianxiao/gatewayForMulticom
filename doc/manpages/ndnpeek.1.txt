response to stdout.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
    Generate the help message.

*-a*::
    Accept stale data in response to the interest.

    Content only, rather than the full ndnb encoded ContentObject, should be
    written to stdout.

*-l* 'lifetime'::
    Specifies the lifetime, in seconds, of the interest.  The lifetime is encoded

*-s* 'scope'::
    Specifies the Scope of the interest, which limits where the interest can
    propagate. A value of 0 limits it to the local *ndnd* cache, 1 to the
    originating system, and 2 to no further than the next system. The default,
    with no scope specified, is unlimited forwarding.

*-u*::
    Allow unverified content to be returned.

*-v*::
    Resolve a version number prior to fetching the final ContentObject.
