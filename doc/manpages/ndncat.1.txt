NAME
----
ndncat - Read streams of NDNx content and write to stdout

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndncat* [-h] [-d 'flags'] [-p 'pipeline'] [-s 'scope'] [-a] 'ndnxnames'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndncat* utility retrieves content published under the
'ndnxnames' and writes it to stdout. The content
must be published as a collection of NDNx Data in accordance with the
naming conventions for segmented streams or files, optionally
unversioned. For the default case of versioned content, *ndncat*
will retrieve the latest version available.

The 'ndnxnames' must be specified using the NDNx URI encoding
syntax. For simple cases of ASCII name components this is just
pathname syntax with / delimiters.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
     Generate the help message.

*-d* 'flags'::
     Specify the fetch debug flags which are the sum of the following:
          NoteGlitch = 1,
          NoteAddRem = 2,
          NoteNeed = 4,
          NoteFill = 8,
          NoteFinal = 16,
          NoteTimeout = 32,
          NoteOpenClose = 64

*-p* 'pipeline'::
     Set the size of the pipeline.  Default 4.

*-s* 'scope'::
     Set the scope (integer) of the interests.  Default unlimited.
     scope may be 0(cache), 1(local), 2(neighborhood), 3(unlimited).

*-a*::
     Allow stale data to be retrieved.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success, approximately, since the fetch client code doesn't currently indicate failure on stream reads.

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error)
