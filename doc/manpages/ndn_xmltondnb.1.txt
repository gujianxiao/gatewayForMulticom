NDN_XMLTONDNB(1)
================

NAME
----
ndn_xmltondnb - convert XML into ndn binary encoded data (ndnb)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndn_xmltondnb* [-hw] [-d 'dict'] 'file' '...'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndn_xmltondnb* converts standard text-based XML into ndn binary encoded (ndnb) form.

OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
	Print usage and exit.

*-d* 'dict'::
	Augment the built-in DTAG dictionary with the named file (format like tagname.csvdict).
	May be repeated.
	Use this if you have defined some ndnb formats of your own.

*-w*::
	Toss UDATA content consisting of only whitespace.
	This is useful if there has been white space added for display purposes (newlines and indentation, for example).
	For NDNx data (e.g. Interest and ContentObject) you probably always want this.

ARGUMENTS
---------
The named files should contain xml data.
Use *-* to specify filter mode (read standard input, write standard output).

OUTPUT
------
If not using filter mode (*-* for the file name), the output file names are generated from the input file names,
using the extension *.ndnb*.
Status and diagnostic messages appear on standard error.

The output may be converted back into regular XML by using the *ndn_ndnbtoxml* utility.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*nonzero*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error, file not found)
