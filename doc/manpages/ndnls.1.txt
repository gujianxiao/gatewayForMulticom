NDNLS(1)
========

NAME
----
ndnls - Attempts to list name components available at the next level of
the hierarchy for a given NDNx name prefix. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndnls* 'ndnxname'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndnls* utility lists name components available after the supplied NDNx
name prefix, 'ndnxname', for content objects that are cached in the local *ndnd*.

This utility does not have explicit flags or options, but can be modified via
environment variables.  These include the scope of the generated interest
('NDN_SCOPE'), the amount of time to wait between responses from *ndnd*
('NDN_LINGER') and whether signature verification is desired ('NDN_VERIFY').


OPTIONS
-------
The *ndnls* utility does not have additional flags or options.  Behavior can
be changed by using the following two environment variables.

    NDN_SCOPE=
      Scope in generated interests (0, 1, 2). The default is none specified.
      
    NDN_LINGER=
      Timeout for not receiving data.  The default is 0.5 seconds.
      
    NDN_VERIFY=
      If set and non-empty, indicates that signature verification is required.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; retrieval error)
