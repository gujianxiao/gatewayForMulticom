NDNDSTATUS(1)
=============

NAME
----
ndndstatus - display the status a running ndnd

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndndstatus [-T host]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndndstatus* displays the status of a running *ndnd*.

This is the same display that is available via a browser at (for example)
http://localhost:9695

It fact, the implementation simply does the http fetch and strips out the html markup.

To access an XML representation of ndndstatus from the browser, request the URL with query string
params f=xml , (for example) http://localhost:9695?f=xml .  The complete description of
the ndndstatus XML representation is available in the technical documentation.  
See link:../technical/NDNDStatus.html[NDND Status Documentation]


OPTIONS
-------
*-T host*::
     Control the *ndnd* instance running on the specified host, instead of the current host.
     To use this option, host must be accessible via tcp.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
The 'NDN_LOCAL_PORT' environment variable may be used to identify
the port that the *ndnd* instance is using; if unset, the default
port number (9695) is used.
