NDNPUTMETA(1)
=============

NAME
----
ndnputmeta - Associate a file with NDNx Content as metadata

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndnputmeta* [-javaopts '<options>'] [-debug '<portno>'] [-v] [-raw] [-unversioned] [-local | -allownonlocal] [-timeout 'millis'] [-log 'LEVEL'] 'ndnxname' 'metaname' 'filename|url'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndnputmeta* utility publishes a local file 'filename' or url 'url' as
metadata associated with the content 'ndnxname'. The metadata is published as 
as of NDNx Data in accordance with the naming conventions for segmented 
streams or files, optionally unversioned. For the default case of versioned 
content, *ndnputmeta* will publish the metadata with the version based on the 
local machine time and will associate it with the latest version of the
referenced NDNx content.

The 'ndnxname' must be specified using the NDNx URI encoding
syntax. For simple cases of ASCII name components this is just
pathname syntax with / delimiters.

The 'metaname' must be the relative path of the metadata for the specified
ndnxname, for example '_thumbnail_/image'.

The 'filename' must be the pathname of a local file that will published under
the 'ndnxname'.

The 'url' must be a valid url to be published under a 'ndnxname'.

*ndnputmeta* will publish versioned and segmented meta data objects, and the 
key used to sign them, to a repository by default.  If there is not a reachable
repository, *ndnputmeta* will exit with a 'wait for put drain' error.  If
there is a corresponding application able to retrieve the content
*ndnputmeta* can be used to publish the content with '-raw'. However no
such application is currently supported. '-raw' allows *ndnputmeta* to skip 
the repository handshake and directly put the content objects to satisfy the
interests expressed by the reader application.

*ndnputmeta* can also be used to publish metadata with a specific key using
'-as' where 'pathToKeystore' must be a valid path to the local filesystem
where a user key has previously been stored.

*ndnputmeta* can additionally be used with access control using the '-ac' flag.


OPTIONS
-------
*-v*::
     Run *ndnputmeta* in verbose mode.

*-raw*::
     *ndnputmeta* will publish the metadata without contacting a
     repository.  This mode will fail unless there is another application,
     capable of reading the metadata, running.

*-unversioned*::
     Do not append a version component to the supplied 'metaname'. This option
     may be used when the supplied 'metaname' already includes an explicit
     version component at the end (which must be URI encoded). This option may
     also be used for metadata content that is organized according to the
     segmentation convention but does not use the versioning
     convention at all. When this option is used, the FileOutputStream
     abstraction will not be used, since that implies versioning.

*-local*::
     Specifies that a local repository be used to save the file.
     This is the (new, as of release 0.5.0) default behavior.

*-allownonlocal*::
     Specifies that either a local or non-local repository be used to save the file.

*-timeout* 'millis'::
     Set the timeout that will be used for putting content objects on
     during the stream reading. I.e., the time to wait for incoming interests.

*-log* 'LEVEL'::
     Set the logging level. 'LEVEL' must be the an acceptable Java
     Logger level: either an integer or a level name (e.g. SEVERE).

*-debug* 'portno'::
	Allows attachment of an eclipse remote debugger to the utility at the specified port number.

*-javaopts* 'options'::
	Allows use of arbitrary java properties or options with the utility.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; publishing error - no processes running that are prepared to ask or already asking for content)

EXAMPLE
-------
The following example publishes a new version of the file "mydocument" and 
adds the file "image.png" as thumbnail metadata for it

    ndnputfile "ndn:/mydocument" "mydocument"
    ndnputmeta "ndn:/mydocument" "_thumbnail_/image.png" "image.png"
