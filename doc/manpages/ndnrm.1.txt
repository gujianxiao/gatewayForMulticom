NDNRM(1)
========

NAME
----
ndnrm - Mark as stale any locally cached content objects matching the given prefixes. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndnrm* [-o 'outfile'] 'ndnxname' ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndnrm* utility marks as _stale_ any matching content objects that
are stored in the local *ndnd* cache.  This makes them unavalable using
ordinary interests, effectively removing them.  This does not affect
neighboring nodes or local applications.

The objects that are marked stale can be written to an output file with
the '-o' option.

The 'ndnxname' prefixes must follow the NDNx name conventions.

OPTIONS
-------

*-o* 'outfile'::
     This option writes out the newly stale content objects to a file.


EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error; retrieval error)

EXAMPLES
--------
This will "remove" everything whose name starts with 'ndn:/ndnx.org/chat':

    ndnrm ndn:/ndnx.org/chat

This will make everything stale, appending the newly stale content objects to
the file stuff.ndnb:

    ccmrm -o - ndn:/ >> stuff.ndnb
