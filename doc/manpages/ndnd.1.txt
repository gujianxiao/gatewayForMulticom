NDND(1)
=======

NAME
----
ndnd - NDNx Daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndnd* [-h]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ndnd* is not normally executed directly. Use *ndndstart(1)* to run an
instance of ndnd. *ndnd* normally runs indefinitely.  Use
*ndndsmoketest(1)* to terminate a *ndnd* (or use *kill(1)*).

*ndnd* is the software forwarder/router for NDNx and is required for
normal NDNx protocol communication.  The typical configuration is to
run one *ndnd* on each host; applications running on the host will
communicate through the local *ndnd*, and it will communicate over
attached networks (directly or through a link adapter process).

*ndnd* takes no options on the command-line. Basic options are controlled
by environment variables. The forwarding table (FIB) is populated with
registration protocols over NDNx.  Use *ndndc(1)* for configuring the
FIB.

*ndnd* communicates via the NDNx protocol running over UDP, TCP, or
Unix domain sockets (the latter for local processes only). It also
provides a simple web status view over HTTP, on the `NDN_LOCAL_PORT`.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*::
	Print a usage message describing environment variables.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

Options for *ndnd* are set via environment variables. 

    NDND_DEBUG=
      0 - no messages
      1 - basic messages (any non-zero value gets these)
      2 - interest messages
      4 - content messages
      8 - matching details
      16 - interest details
      32 - gory interest details
      64 - log occasional human-readable timestamps
      128 - face registration debugging
      bitwise OR these together for combinations; -1 gets max logging
    NDN_LOCAL_PORT=
      UDP port for unicast clients (default 9695).
      Also listens on this TCP port for stream connections.
      Also affects name of unix-domain socket.
    NDN_LOCAL_SOCKNAME=
      Name stem of unix-domain socket (default /tmp/.ndnd.sock).
    NDND_CAP=
      Capacity limit, in count of ContentObjects.
      Not an absolute limit.
    NDND_MTU=
      Packet size in bytes.
      If set, interest stuffing is allowed within this budget.
      Single items larger than this are not precluded.
    NDND_DATA_PAUSE_MICROSEC=
      Adjusts content-send delay time for multicast and udplink faces
    NDND_DEFAULT_TIME_TO_STALE=
      Default for content objects without explicit FreshnessSeconds,
      in seconds.  Must be positive.
    NDND_MAX_TIME_TO_STALE=
      Limit, in seconds, until content becomes stale.  Must be positive.
      If necessary, this will be reduced to the largest value
      that the implemementation can enforce.
    NDND_MAX_RTE_MICROSEC=
      Value used to limit response time estimates kept by default strategy.
    NDND_KEYSTORE_DIRECTORY=
      Directory readable only by ndnd where its keystores are kept
      Defaults to a private subdirectory of /var/tmp
    NDND_LISTEN_ON=
      List of ip addresses to listen on; defaults to wildcard. The
      addresses may be enclosed in square brackets.  The list elements
      are separated by whitespace, commas, or semicolons.  Both IPv4 and
      IPv6 addresses may be used.  Set this if you want to limit
      connectivity to a particular set of configured addresses.
      The most useful non-default setting is probably "localhost".
      Note that outgoing tcp connections may still be made.
    NDND_AUTOREG=
      List of prefixes to auto-register on new faces initiated by peers.
      The prefixes are represented as ndnx URIs, and
      are separated by whitespace, commas, or semicolons.
      If this is specified, the ndnd can be used as a "hub" to forward
      interests matching these prefixes to any peer that talks to it.
      example: NDND_AUTOREG=ndn:/ndnx.org/Users,ndn:/ndnx.org/Chat
    NDND_PREFIX=
      A prefix stem to use for generating guest prefixes.

NAME SPACES
-----------
After *ndnd* starts, control of its behavior takes place using NDNx protocols.
For more information, please refer to
link:../technical/NameConventions.html[NameConventions]
int the technical documentation.

This is where ndnd publishes its key, using the service discovery profile:

    ndn:/%C1.M.S.localhost/%C1.M.SRV/ndnd

For the benefit of neighboring nodes, the key is published here as well:

    ndn:/%C1.M.S.neighborhood/%C1.M.SRV/ndnd

The following is the main prefix used to communicate with this instance of ndnd.
Here +<ndndid>+ refers to the SHA256 digest of the ndnd's public key.
Note that, for historical reasons, this does not use the key marker convention.
Each instance of ndnd may be assumed to be using a distict public key.
See link:../technical/Registration.html[Registration] for a description of
the protocols used in in this namespace.

    ndn:/ndnx/<ndndid>

A stream of face status changes may be obtained through the the name below.
This uses the standard versioning and segmentation profiles, so a utility
such as *ndncat* may be used to read it.  At present, only one version of
the stream is started when it is requested for the first time, so a program
that needs to access it should start shortly after *ndnd* and run as long as
the *ndnd* instance is around. The format of this stream is a simple
text-based one.

    ndn:/ndnx/<ndndid>/notice.txt

When two ndnds begin exchanging interest and data, an automatic handshake
takes place to agree upon a name prefix that both nodes can use to refer
to the communication channel.
This prefix is registered on each node to forward interests to the other.
An example of such a prefix is

    ndn:/%C1.M.FACE/%C1.M.G%00%00XL%DB%F0%0A%0APn%0F%B1%F2%1F

The first name component is always the same.
The second component is a randomly-generated guid, with a guid marker.
(These guids are abbreviated below to make them easier to read.)

As a byproduct of this handshake,
each ndnd creates a content object that represents its endpoint.
For example:

    ndn:/%C1.M.FACE/%C1.M.G%00%00XL42/%C1.M.NODE/%C1.M.K%00...1/face~7/%FD...
    ndn:/%C1.M.FACE/%C1.M.G%00%00XL42/%C1.M.NODE/%C1.M.K%00...2/face~9/%FD...

The third component is the constant +%C1.M.NODE+,
to allow the remainder if the namespace to be used for other purposes.
The fourth component is the ndndid, with the key digest marker.  These have
been abbreviated in the example.
The fifth component is the faceid, in decimal ascii,
with a leading distinguisher of 'face~'.
The remaining two components are for standard versioning and segmentation.

Currently there is no payload in these content objects.
This is subject to change.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
     Success

*1*::
     Failure (syntax or usage error)
