NDNDSTART(1)
============

NAME
----
ndndstart - Start ndnd in the background and set up forwarding according to configuration

SYNOPSIS
--------
*ndndstart*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *ndndstart* utility starts ndnd in the background.
*ndndstart* looks for configuration of forwarding information in
'$HOME/.ndnx/ndnd.conf'; refer to *ndndc(1)* for the format.
If *ndnd* is already running, it will be shut down and restarted;
any manually-configured forwarding (with *ndndc*) will need to be re-executed.

*ndndstart* will start using default values for 'NDND_CAP', 'NDND_DEBUG' and
the default port 9695 for 'NDN_LOCAL_PORT'.  These environment values may
be set to change the cache size, *ndnd* debug logging, and port number, respectively.
The values may be set in '$HOME/.ndnx/ndndrc', which is sourced at startup.

OPTIONS
-------

This utility does not have have flags or arguments.

These environment variables are handled by *ndndstart*:

     NDND_LOG
     NDND_PRELOAD

'NDND_LOG' is the name of the log file.  If none is specified, the
log output appears on *stderr*.

'NDND_PRELOAD' is a list of file names for files containing ndnb-encoded
content objects.  These will be preloaded into the ndnd's cache at startup.
See *ndnrm(1)* for one way to make such a file.

If the environment variable 'NDNR_GLOBAL_PREFIX' is set, *ndndstart* will
also start an instance of the *ndnr* repository, using the directory
'$HOME/.ndnx/repository' to contain the backing files.
Additional configuration for this instance may be placed in the file
'$HOME/.ndnx/repository/config'.

Please see *ndnd(1)* and *ndnr(1)* for additional environment variables.
